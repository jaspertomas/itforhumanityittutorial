<h3>Lesson 1. What is Hypertext?</h3>
HTML is the language of the web. It is the language that is used to build web pages and web sites. 
<br>
<br>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. What does that mean? To know what hypertext is, we need to know what text is.
<br>
<br>
Text is anything that you can read. Text books are books that contain a lot of text. Text messages are messages that are made of text. 
<br>
<br>Hypertext is called hypertext for the same reason that Superman is called Superman. Superman is a super man. He is a man who is super. In the same way, Hypertext is hyper text. It is text that is hyper. =D 
<br>
<br>It is hyper because it has color and size. It can be underlined, bold or italicized. It can be clicked, and when it is clicked, it can open a new web page. It can show pictures. It can create tables and lists. And it can other things. This is why hypertext is more hyper than text. 
<br>
<br>This is text: 
<br>
<br>Hello world! 
<br>
<br>And this is hypertext: 
<br>
<br><i><font color=red size=7>Hello world! </font></i>

<h3>Lesson 2: Your first web page</h3>
Create a new file and name it mypage.html . (Notice that there is no space between 'my' and 'page'. ) 
<br>
<br>Type (or select and copy) the following code into your new file.
<br>
<br><textarea cols=80><font color=red size=7>Hello world!</font></textarea>
<br>
<br>Now open your new file using the File Manager.
<br>
<br>What do you see? Your file should look something like this:
<br>
<br><font color=red size=7>Hello world! </font>
<br>
<br>Congratulations, you have just created your very first web page. 
<br>
<br>Building a web page is like writing a document in Microsoft Word. You can adjust the size and color of the letters, change the font, make the letters bold, underlined or italicized. 
<br>
<br>For those using a tablet, it will be easier for you to study HTML by using the app HTML Play (or its free version, HTML Play Lite). Look for it in your tablet. If you don't have it installed, download and install it from the Play Store.
<br>
<br>Now open HTML Play and use it instead of Jota+. HTML Play will allow you to see the results of your work with one click of a button.
<br>
<br>Again, type (or select and paste) the code into HTML Play.
<br>
<br><textarea cols=80><font color=red size=7>Hello world!</font></textarea>
<br>
<br>Now click on the Preview button. What do you see? It should be something like 
<br>
<br><font color=red size=7>Hello world!</font>
<br>
<br>Click the HTML button to go back to the code. Remove the words 'color=red' and click Preview. What do you see?
<br>
<br><font size=7>Hello world!</font>
<br>
<br>Click the HTML button again and remove the words 'size=7' and click Preview. What do you see?
<br>
<br><font >Hello world!</font>
<br>
<br>Finally, remove the words '&lt;font&gt;' and '&lt;/font&gt;' and click Preview. What do you see?
<br>
<br><font >Hello world!</font>
<hr>
<h3>Lesson 3: Open and close tags</h3>
Html is made up of tags.  '&lt;font&gt;' is a tag. It is the very first tag we will learn. We will learn more tags later.  
<br>
<br>Tags are what make hypertext hyper. Without the tags, hypertext is just, well, text. We tried this in the previous lesson. We started out with a big red 
<br>
<br><font color=red size=7>Hello world!</font>
<br>
<br>removed the tags, and ended up with just 
<br>
<br>Hello world!.
