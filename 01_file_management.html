<h3>What is a file?</h3>
When you take a picture with your tablet, that picture is a file. MP3's are files. Videos are files. Documents written using a computer are files. Files are pieces of information that are stored inside a computer. And your tablet is a computer.  
<br>
<br>Files have first names and last names, like people. Files have names like: 
<br>
<br>report.doc
<br>id_picture.jpg
<br>michaeljackson_billyjean.mp3
<br>my_birthday_party.mp4
<br>index.html
<br>
<br>Their last name tells you what kind of file they are. These last names are also called 'file name extensions'. They are usually 3 letters long, like mp3, jpg, png, avi, wmv, php, etc. MP3 files are usually music. When you take pictures with your tablet, the pictures are usually JPG files. MP4, AVI and WMV files are video files. HTM, HTML and PHP files are web pages. 
<br>
<br>These are files
<br>
<img src=images/01/files.png width=50%>
<br>
<br>There is a special kind of file that contains other files. It is called a Folder, also known as a Directory. Folders look like those cardboard folders you can buy in a book store. Folders usually do not have a last name.
<br>
<br>This is a folder
<br>
<img src=images/01/folder.png width=50%>
<br>
<br>There are many things that you can do with files. You can copy them, move them around, delete them, edit them, etc.  
<hr>
<h3>The File Manager</h3>
This is the File Manager app<br>
<img src=images/01/filemgrwhere.png width=50%>
<!--br><br><img src=images/01/filemgr.png width=50%-->
<br>
<br>Let's create a file, and try doing something with it using the File Manager. Take a picture with your tablet's camera.
<br>
<br>The camera saves its pictures in the folder /mnt/sdcard/DCIM/camera. To see your picture, do this:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Open the File Manager app
	<li>Click on 'sdcard'
	<li>Look for 'DCIM' and click on it
	<li>Click on 'Camera'
	<li>Your picture will be the one at the bottom of the list.
</ul>
<br>

<a name=filemgrgotocamera>
<img src=images/01/filemgrgotocamera.gif width=75%>
<br><a href=images/01/filemgrgotocamera/index.html>View individual slides here</a>

<br>
<br>There's your picture. Click on it to see what it looks like. If you have taken a lot of pictures, your picture will be at the very bottom of the list. 
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Folders</h3>
Folders allow your computer to arrange your files in a neat way. There are thousands of files in your tablet, but you don't see them because they are in the other folders. Imagine if your picture was with thousands of other files. It would take hours for you to find your picture!
<br>
<br>In the activity earlier, we opened 3 folders to find your picture: sdcard, DCIM and Camera. Camera is your picture's 'parent folder'. DCIM is the parent of Camera, and sdcard is the parent of DCIM. It's like they are all one big family. The parent of sdcard is mnt. We did not have to go through mnt, because when we opened the File Manager, we were already inside mnt.
<br>
<br>Another way to think of the folders is by thinking that they are addresses, like the address of your home. Inside the world are different countries. Inside those are provinces, cities, streets, and houses. Notice that the address of your home contains your street, your city, and your province. For example:

<br>
<br>1234 Rizal Avenue, Santa Cruz, Manila, Philippines
<br>
<br>
Folders are the same. 
<br>
<br>The address of your picture can be written like this:
<br>
<br>/mnt/sdcard/DCIM/Camera/verylongfilename.jpg
<br>
<br><img src=images/01/path.png width=75%>
<br>
<br>From now on, when I ask you to go to a folder, I will use its address. For example, if I need you to go to the folder sdcard, I will tell you to go to  /mnt/sdcard.
<hr>
<h3>The Root Folder</h3>
The parent of mnt is called the 'root folder'. It is like Adam or Eve, because it is the parent of all the files and folders. It doesn't have a name, but it is very important because all the files in your tablet are inside it. It is like 'Planet Earth'.  Nobody needs to say 'Planet Earth' in their address, because everybody lives in Planet Earth. 
<br>
<br>The address of the root folder is
<br>
<br>/
<br>
<br>When I tell you to go to /, that means you need to go to the root folder. But File Manager doesn't really let you go to the root folder, so don't worry about it.
<hr>
<h3>Your Very Own Folder</h3>
Now, let's create your own personal folder, where we will put your files for safe keeping. Let's call it 'myfiles'.
<br>
<ul>
	<li>If you are still inside /mnt/sdcard/DCIM/Camera, Go to /mnt/sdcard
	<li>Click on the options button
	<li>Click on New Folder
	<li>Enter the name 'myfiles'
	<li>Click 'Create'
</ul>
<a name=createyourfolder>
<img src=images/01/createyourfolder.gif width=75%>
<br><a href=images/01/createyourfolder/index.html>View individual slides here</a>
<br>
<br>There. Now you have your very own folder. 

<hr>
<h3>Managing Pictures</h3>

Let's take your picture, change its name to something more appropriate, and put it in your folder.
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Go to /mnt/sdcard/DCIM/Camera
	<li>Press on your picture with your finger (or mouse) until a menu appears
	<li>Click on Rename File
	<li>Enter the name 'mypic'
	<li>Click 'Rename'
</ul>
<a name=renametomypic>
<img src=images/01/renametomypic.gif width=75%>
<br><a href=images/01/renametomypic/index.html>View individual slides here</a>
<br>
<br>Notice that Rename did not change the file extension (or last name) of your file. It only changed the first name.
<br>
<br>Now let's move your picture to your folder.
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Press on your picture with your finger (or mouse) until a menu appears
	<li>Click on Move (Cut) File
	<li>Notice the message that says "Holding mypic.jpg". 
	<li>Go to /mnt/sdcard/myfiles
	<li>Click on <img src=images/01/fileoperationstab.png width=20>
	<li>Click 'Paste'
</ul>

<a name=movetomyfiles>
<img src=images/01/movetomyfiles.gif width=75%>
<br><a href=images/01/movetomyfiles/index.html>View individual slides here</a>

<br>
<br>The message saying 'Holding mypic.jpg' means that there is a file in the 'clipboard' or memory, and that you can paste the file in a different folder. Remember the previous lesson, where we copied some words into the clipboard, and pasted them into another box? Here we are copying a file into the clipboard and pasting it into another folder.
<hr>
<h3>Other things you can do with Files</h3>
You now know how to create folders, and how to rename and move files. You can also delete or erase files, and copy them, by using the other buttons in the file operations menu. <br>
<br><img src=images/01/fileoperationsmenu.png width=50%>

<hr>
<h3>Copying many files at the same time</h3>
There is another way to work with files that lets you copy (or move, or delete) many files at the same time.
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Click on <img src=images/01/fileoperationstab.png width=20>
	<li>Click, one at a time, on the files that you wish to copy 
	<li>Click Copy
	<li>Go to the folder where you wish to copy the files
	<li>Click on <img src=images/01/fileoperationstab.png width=20>
	<li>Click 'Paste'
</ul>

<a name= multicopy>
<img src=images/01/multicopy.gif width=75%>
<br><a href=images/01/multicopy/index.html>View individual slides here</a>

<br>
<br>This is called multiselect or multiple selection.
<br>
<br>Sometimes multiple selection stops working. When this happens, click <img src=images/01/fileoperationstab.png width=20> twice (2 times) to turn multiple selection off and back on again.

<h3>Copying and Cutting Files</h3>
What's the difference between copying a file and moving (or cutting) it?
<br>
<br>Remember in the previous lesson, where we copied and cut words? When you copy words, you don't delete the original words. When you move (or cut) words, you delete the old words and put them somewhere else.
<br>
<br>When you copy a file, the original file stays where it is, so you have 2 copies of the same file. If something bad happens to one of the files, you still have one. 
<br>
<br>When you move (or cut) a file, the original file is deleted. If something bad happens to the new file, it is gone.
<br>
<br>It is a good idea to make copies of important files and put them in a safe place. This is called backing up or making a back up.

<hr>
<h3>Working with Folders</h3>
Folders are also files, so you can also rename, copy, move and delete them in the same way. 
<br>
<br>When you copy a folder, you copy all the files and folders inside it. If you have many files that you copy or move often, it will be easier if you put them inside a folder, and copy or move the folder instead.

<hr>
<h3>Overwriting Existing Files</h3>
<img src=images/01/overwrite.png width=50%>
<br>
<br>
Folders cannot have two files with the same file name inside them. When a folder already has a file with a certain name, and you copy (or move) into it another file with the same name, you will be asked if you wish to delete the old file, to give way to the new file. If you click Copy (or Move), the old file will be gone, and the file being copied will take its place. This is called Overwriting.
<br>

<br>If you want to keep the old file, you can rename it before you copy the new file. Or you can rename the new file. Or you can create a new folder, and paste the new file in there.

<h3><a name="Accessing_flash_disks">Accessing flash disks</span></h3>
 You should only connect 1 flash disk at a time. If you connect 2 flash disks, your tablet will probably not be able to read the second one.
<br><br>
If you have a usb hub, just connect your flash disk to your usb hub.
<br>
<br><img src=images/01/usbconnect3.jpg width=50%>
<br>
<br>If you do not have a usb hub, disconnect your usb keyboard from your usb-to-microusb adapter and instead insert the flash disk. 
<br>
<br><img src=images/01/usbconnect1.jpg width=50%>
<br>
<br><img src=images/01/usbconnect2.jpg width=50%>
<br>
<br>Now, open File Manager and click on the USB tab.
