<h3>Text Files</h3>
Text is anything that you can read - words and numbers. A book full of text is called a Textbook. A message made of text is called a Text Message. A file containing only text is called a text file. Text files have the last name '.txt'.
<br>
<br>These are text files. They contain lyrics from Michael Jackson's songs.

<br>
<br>A text file contains nothing but text. No colors, no letters of different sizes, no alignment, no bold, italic or underline, no pictures or tables. Just text.

<br>
<br>
<br>Some programs such as Microsoft Word let you change the size and color of the text. It allows you to align the text to the left, center or right. These changes are called 'Formatting'. Microsoft Word produces Document Files, or files with the last name '.doc'. Document files contain formatting. Text files do not. 
<br>
<br>This is a document file inside Microsoft Word

<br>
<br>Document files are more difficult to write than text files. Let's learn how to use a text editor first. We will learn how to use programs like Microsoft Word in a different lesson. 
<br>
<br>Picture files, MP3 files, and video files are not text files. If you open those kinds of files using a text editor, you will see that they are made up of a lot of stuff that you can't read, made up of lots of jumbled letters and symbols. It is called 'garbage'. 
<br>
<br>When you open a picture, video or mp3 file with a text editor, you get garbage.

<h3>Text Editors</h3>
A program for writing text files is called a text editor. 
<br>
<br>There are many apps that can be used to edit files in an android tablet. The one I recommend is Jota+.

<h3>The Cursor</h3>
When you open Jota, notice that there's this blinking '|'. This is the cursor. The cursor marks the place where the letters appear when you type.

<h3>Know your keyboard</h3>
Before we start typing, let's get to know our keyboard.

<h3>Creating your first text file</h3>
If you have not installed Jota+ yet, install it now. You can download it <a href=apps>here</a>.
<br>
<br>
Also, make sure that your keyboard is connected. Press the Num Lock key. The Num Lock light should light up. (The Num Lock Light is above the Num Lock key) Press the Num Lock key again to turn it off. If it does not light up, it means your keyboard is loose. Disconnect and reconnect your keyboard.

<br>
<br>Now, let us create your first file. 
<br>

<ul>
	<li>Open Jota+
	<li>Type something. For example, type 'Hello' or your name.
	<li>Click on 'save'
	<li>Go to your folder (myfiles)
	<li>Change the filename to myfile.txt
	<li>Click 'save'
</ul>
<a name=yourfirsttextfile>

<br>
<br>Now open the File Manager and go to myfiles to see that myfile.txt really is there.
