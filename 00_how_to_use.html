<br>This tutorial is for Filipinos who live in the provinces, and other people who are not very good at english and do not have a lot of money. This will show you how to learn Information Technology and Computer Programming without a laptop or desktop computer. 
<br>
<br>This tutorial is designed to be used with an android tablet with a usb keyboard, and maybe even a usb mouse, as shown below. Mozilla Firefox Browser for Android is recommended.

<h3>Don't try to finish each lesson in one sitting</h3>
Very important reminder: Know when to rest. The lessons are not designed to be finished in one sitting. There are students that try to learn so much at once, then give up when they get tired. 
<br>
<br>Slow and steady finishes the race. Study at your own pace. 
<hr>
<h3>Choosing a Tablet</h3>
Any tablet will do, as long as its Android version is Jellybean (Android 4.0) or higher. I recommend a tablet with a separate power adapter port (besides the microusb port), so you can use your keyboard and charge your tablet at the same time. If not, you might have to stop studying to charge your tablet every few hours.

<h3>Apps</h3>
The apps that we will be using in this tutorial can be downloaded <a href="apps/">here</a>. Download them and install them into your tablet.
<hr>
<h3>Select, Copy and Paste</h3>
Whenever you see something like this
<br>
<br><textarea cols=80>Hi mom!</textarea>
<br>
<br>often it is to show code that you will have to type. Instead of typing it one letter at a time, you can save time by simply copying it like this: Click inside the box and press Ctrl-A (Control-A) to select all of its contents. Ctrl-A means 'Select All'.
<br>
<br>Press, and don't let go of, the Right Ctrl key with your right hand. Then press and let go of the A key with your left hand. Then let go of the Ctrl key. Notice that the words in the box will turn orange. This means that you have successfully selected the words in the box.
<br>
<br>Then press Ctrl-C to copy the contents to memory, also known as 'clipboard'. (Ctrl-C means Copy.) When you do this, you will see a message saying 'Text copied to clipboard'. You can then paste the contents of the clipboard into other textboxes, like this one below. Click inside it, and press Ctrl-V. (Ctrl-V means Paste.)
<br>
<br><textarea cols=80></textarea>
<br>
<br>Another way to press Ctrl-A is to press and hold down the Left Ctrl key with your left little finger, then press the A key with your left ring or middle finger. Try both methods and see which one you are more comfortable with.
<br>
<br>You can also paste the words into other apps. This will save you a lot of time later. Please practice doing it until you are comfortable with it. 
<br>
<br>Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V are called 'Shortcut Keys'.
<hr>
<h3>Select, Cut and Paste</h3>
Another way to copy words is to 'cut' or 'move' them. Select the words 'Hi mom!' in the box below again, but instead of pressing Ctrl-C to copy, use Ctrl-X.
<br>
<br><textarea cols=80>Hi mom!</textarea>
<br>
<br>Notice that the words disappeared. Now click inside the box below and press Ctrl-V. 
<br>
<br><textarea cols=80></textarea>
<br>
<br>You have just moved the words from the first box to the second box. This is called cutting or moving. 
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Selecting just a few words</h3>
Select a sentence in this webpage by doing this. 
<br>
<br>
Click (touch the screen with your finger, or click with your mouse) and hold on the first word of this sentence for a second or two. Notice that the word 'Click' has turned orange, and orange arrows have appeared, marking the beginning and end of the letters you have selected. 
<br>
<br><img src=images/00/select.png >
<br>
<br>
Press and don't let go of the Left Shift key with your left hand. Now, with your right hand, press the Right Arrow key several times. Watch as the orange highlight grows, one letter at a time. 
<br>
<br>
Press and hold down the Right Arrow key for a long time. Do this until the entire sentence is orange. If you go past the last word, press the Left Arrow key to go back. Then let go of the Shift key. 
<br>
<br>
You have now selected a sentence. Copy the sentence by pressing Ctrl-C, and then paste it into the text box below by clicking inside it and pressing Ctrl-V.
<br>
<br><textarea cols=80></textarea>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Switching between apps</h3>
You will usually have 3 or 4 apps open at the same time. To switch quickly between apps, use the Alt-Tab shortcut key.
<br>
<br>First, make sure that there are at least 3 apps open. If not, open some apps. 
<br>
<br>Now press and hold down the Alt key. Then press and quickly let go of the Tab key. Do not let go of the Alt key yet. You should see something like this:
<br>
<br><img src=images/00/alttab.png width=50%>
<br>
<br>Notice that in the picture, the Browser app (the one that looks like a planet) is highlighted (or has a blue circle around it).
<br>
<br>Press the Tab key again. Watch the highlight move to the next app. Keep pressing the Tab key until the highlight is on top of the app you wish to open. Now let go of the Alt key. This will open the app that you have chosen.
<hr>
<h3>Adjusting font size in Firefox Browser</h3>
You can make the letters in your Firefox browser larger or smaller like this:
<br><a name=enlargefontsize>
<br><img src=images/00/enlargefontsize.gif width=75%>
<br>
<br><a href=images/00/enlargefontsize/index.html#enlargefontsize>If you find the slide show to be too fast, view the individual slides here</a>
<br>
<br>To restart the animation, refresh this web page (Shortcut key: Ctrl-R)
